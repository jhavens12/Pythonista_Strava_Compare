# Pythonista_Strava_Compare
Pythonista applet for comparing multiple strava athletes

This was one of my first experiences with Pythonista

Code is very old compared to what I'm working on now (stopped touching it around 7.25.17) - but was the first working pythonista demo i had

requires credentials file which includes api_key, smash_token along with usernames of strava athletes

It should be noted that you can only pull so many activities from other athletes as it depends on your feed. If you follow more people you will see less activities for each user
